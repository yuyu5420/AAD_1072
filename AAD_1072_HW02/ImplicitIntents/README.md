ImplicitIntents - Solution Code
===============================

This is the Starter Code for 02.3 Homework.

Introduction
----------
The ImplicitIntents app demonstrates the use of implicit intents for starting
activities. It contains three buttons for sending implicit intents:

* Open a URL in a browser.
* Find a location on a map.
* Share a text string.

Test Cases
--------

#### `@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class) public class TakePictureTest`

Tests for the 12.Homework "Build and run an app" in Android fundamentals 02.3: Implicit intents

 * **See also:** <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-training-activity-with-implicit-intent/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Fandroid-training#11">02.3: Implicit intents</a>

#### `@Test public void testTakePictureButtonLocation()`

[1]  It displays a Take a Picture button at the bottom of the app.

#### `@Test public void takePictureActionTest()`

[2]  When the Button is clicked, launch a camera app to take a picture. (You don't need to return the picture to the original app.)
